# Challenge1

This challenge involved cleaning up the CSS code and fixing some of the html

I combined what elements I could into single attribute statements and created some
variables in order to clean up some of the repetition in the CSS.

I fixed the title in html code, the link for the Search Engine Optimization list item, and placed alt text for the images.
